In this assignment I was able to work on a creative Quiz using Html, Css and JavaScript.

To be able to complete the quiz, I had to first creative the web page in which consisted with Html and Css. Althoug, the page looks a bit simple, I was able to be creative and practice on my creativity and quickness to get the design of a page with more frequency and effectiveness. 

Working with JavaScript in order to make the quiz alive was something new and different. I was able to completed this part of the assignment by simply googling every details to come up with the best possible way to get it done.
